It has 3 pages, the Home, Menu and Contact page. The Home page is rendered first once the DOMContentLoaded event it's called in index.js, then it attached on click event listeners to all the buttons in the navigation bar, that calls a different callback depending on the button clicked to generate it's respective module for the Home, Menu and Contact pages. The modules are the home.js in charge of generating the Home page, menu.js in charge of generating the Menu page, contact.js in charge of generating the Contact page, and to make less code a divBox.js module and a navbar.js was created, the divBox handles the creation of a div that generates the content base on the different inputs and the navbar in charge of generating a navbar for the navigation.
